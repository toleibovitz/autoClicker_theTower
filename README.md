# Project Description

## This is a autoClicker for the game TheTower.  It utilizes OCR text technology to read various parts of the game window and clicks in the appropriate places.  Currently, this app only works on Windows due to how MacOS handles detecting windows.  When a round ends, the autoClicker also saves the round-stats to CSV for later use and analysis.

## It utilizes a GUI to start and stop the autoClicker as needed.  

## Future Additions
- Add logic to read the CSV files and create graphs in the GUI
- Add more logic to handle clicking upgrades automatically
- Add tournament mode
- Add logic to handle when game cards change the main screen graphics (which changes the layout of icons, and thus affects what is OCR'd)
